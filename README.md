# Abstractive Text Summarization

## Introduction

In this modern era, data are getting generated day by day, and extracting the important information
from this huge amount of data has become a laborious and time-consuming task. So, to get the
important information from these lengthier documents we need text summarization. The job to
summarize a text document is to generate a short summary that consists of a few sentences and
captures the main idea of text document. Text summarization is a very important and interesting
problem in natural language understanding. It gives a precise summary so that humans can
understand the gist of long documents in less time.

### Types of Text Summarization
<p>
<b>1. Extractive Text Summarization</b> <br>
Extractive text summarization (ETS) is just extracting the important key-
words, phrases, sentences, and combining them to produce a summary<br>
Example : Heena went to NLP LAB. There, she setup her system.<br>
Extractive Summary : Heena went NLP LAB setup her system.<br>
In the above example, important words are selected and merged to generate the extractive
summary. <br><br>
<b>2. Abstractive Text Summarization</b> <br>
Abstractive text summarization (ABS) generates a more powerful summary
by generating new keywords, phrases, sentences and combine them to make a summary like humans
do. <br>
Example : Heena went to NLP LAB. There, she setup her system.<br>
Abstractive Summary : Heena visited NLP LAB to ready the system.<br>
In the above example, sentences are compressed and paraphrased to generate the abstractive
summary.
